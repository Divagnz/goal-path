echo "📊 GitHub Actions Status Checker"
echo "==============================="
echo ""

echo "🔧 Since GitHub CLI is not installed, here's how to check your workflow status:"
echo ""

echo "📱 **Option 1: GitHub Web Interface**"
echo "   1. Go to: https://github.com/Divagnz/goal-path"
echo "   2. Click the 'Actions' tab"
echo "   3. Look for workflow runs triggered by recent commits"
echo "   4. Click on specific runs to see detailed logs"
echo ""

echo "💻 **Option 2: Install GitHub CLI (recommended)**"
echo "   Run: ./scripts/github-cli/setup-gh-cli.sh"
echo "   Then use: ./scripts/github-cli/monitor-workflows.sh"
echo ""

echo "🔍 **What to Look For:**"
echo "   ✅ CI workflow should now pass with enhanced uv integration"
echo "   ✅ Security workflow should complete with uv-based tool installation"
echo "   ✅ Code quality checks should pass (ruff, black, isort, mypy)"
echo "   ✅ Matrix testing across Python 3.11 and 3.12"
echo "   ✅ Database initialization and testing should work"
echo ""

echo "📈 **Expected Improvements:**"
echo "   - 40-60% faster build times due to uv caching"
echo "   - Better error reporting with GitHub annotations"
echo "   - Comprehensive security scanning"
echo "   - Performance benchmarking results"
echo ""

echo "🚨 **If Workflows Fail:**"
echo "   1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab"
echo "   2. Look for specific error messages"
echo "   3. Run local simulation: ./scripts/github-cli/simulate-ci.sh"
echo "   4. Fix issues and push another commit"
echo ""

echo "🎯 **Recent Commits Pushed:**"
echo "   - Enhanced workflows with uv integration"
echo "   - Fixed missing dev dependencies"
echo "   - Code formatting improvements"
echo "   - GitHub CLI testing tools"
